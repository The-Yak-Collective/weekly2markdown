### What did you do last week?
build logging system
### What do you plan to do next week?
vacation
### Any blockers?
hope not...
### What's one interesting thing from last week
logging, even at 1Hz seems to interfere with sending commands to servers, so movement quality deteriorates.  need to see if this is due to hardware limit or the same software works or even just a multi-tasking problem. another possibility is avoidable bus clashes.
