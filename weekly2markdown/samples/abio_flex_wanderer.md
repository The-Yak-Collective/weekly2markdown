### Build Name
Abio Flex Wanderer
### What did you do last week?
(Starting to) Evaluating self-organizing memory (SOM) to implement our situation-construction software for autonomous rovers. Also evaluating reinforcement learning approach to maintain the SOM. No code at all, and Maier and I are collecting data at this point.

We have also defined a working scenario, and our goal is to deliver demos to our next presentation slots.
### What do you plan to do next week?
Basically same, possible some code.
### Any blockers?
No blocker.
### What's one interesting thing from last week
Casting our problem to SOM and RL starts feeling close to get real and useful. We started with clustering algorithms, and still on the list.

### What did you do last week?
(1) Review spider bot logs to frame more collection. This data is to serve in situation modelling, the target we are working on recently. (2) Preparing clear content for my presentation on logic reasoning (notably on abductive reasoning) in two weeks.
### What do you plan to do next week?
(1) Push on the spider bot maker HiWonder to understand how to program the servo controller. Maier is having a hard time collecting data with Python, and I have this question pending for too long. (2) Continue on the presentation preps.
### Any blockers?
None.
### What's one interesting thing from last week
I am getting motivated by my talk on abductive reasoning. I have not presented about it for more than a decade, and believing it can help a lot in AI and robotics, so potentially good contribution (and perhaps somewhat unique) to our project.
