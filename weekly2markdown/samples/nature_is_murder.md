### Build Name
Nature is Murder
### What did you do last week?
Finished printing all parts for the Accessory Before the Fact (ABFT) test rig, learned to print TPU (for tires)
### What do you plan to do next week?
Assemble ABTF and get motors to turn on and off on Beaglebone
### Any blockers?
Nope. Gathering momentum, yipee kai yay.
### What's one interesting thing from last week
It's easier to design compliance into a mechanism with geometry than with tolerances.

### Build Name
Nature is Murder
### What did you do last week?
Random yak-shave achievement: printing tires out of TPU (soft, rubber-like 3d printer filament), so now I can design my own full wheels with tires.
### What do you plan to do next week?
Finish building ABTF
### Any blockers?
My bottleneck is now the wire harness construction. No method seems easy/reliable based on my skill level.
### What's one interesting thing from last week
Optimization rules. Getting the right settings for printing TPU made a night and day difference.
